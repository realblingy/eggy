In order to launch the website, you must execute python eggy.py. If there are any bugs 
or issues, feel free to let me know. The algorithm for website scraping is still very
janky so it will only work with simple and popular items. For example it will work
well with "Nintendo Switch" but not "Sweet sugar lollies". It also only works with
correct spelling.
