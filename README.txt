## Instructions

In order to launch the website, you must execute python eggy.py. The algorithm for website scraping is 
still very janky so it will only work with simple and popular items. For example it will work
well with "Nintendo Switch" but not "Sweet sugar lollies". 

It also only works with correct spelling and stores in AUSTRALIA ONLY. 

If there are any bugs or issues, feel free to let me know.
